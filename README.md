# README

The API documentation is included in this project in the `docs/api-docs.json` file.

We test the publicly available website: [https://awesome.byst.re](https://awesome.byst.re).

The backend source code is also publicly available one directory above, in the `test-secure-backend` folder.

Swagger is publicly available as well, so it can be checked when needed: [https://awesome.byst.re/swagger-ui/index.html](https://awesome.byst.re/swagger-ui/index.html).

The login endpoint can be checked with `curl`.

In Bash:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://awesome.byst.re/api/v1/users/signin' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"username":"<username>","password":"<password>"}'
```

In PowerShell, use `curl.exe` with `--%`:

```powershell
curl.exe --% -X POST https://awesome.byst.re/api/v1/users/signin -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"<username>\",\"password\":\"<password>\"}"
```
